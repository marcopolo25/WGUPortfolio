                           <p>It's a me, Marco. In text, it might sound grammatically incorrect or absurd. This is an attempt to sound like my favorite game character, Mario from the Mario Brothers frachise. As you can see the name are very close with the exception of one letter.</p>

                           <h3>In Kingston, Jamaica</h3>
                           <p>A little background about me. I was born in the city of Kingston, which is the capital of Jamaica. My birth was extremely complicated, because I had a deformity of my feet called congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) or clubfoot. I am very thankful for the mother God gave me as she percevire to ensure that one day I would be considered normal, and it paid off. After a slew of intense surgeries and rehab, I was finally about to walk at the age of 2. A miracle indeed. I spent 19 years of my life in Jamaica, then I migrated to the United States in pursuit of a higher education.</p>

                           <p>Being in the States, I've learnt a lot about this country, its history, its people and I was able to learn a lot about myself. I've had the opportunity to enroll in many schools and acheive my goals with flying colors. Within every journey, you will face obstacles and mine was completing my bachelors. So now I'm enrolled in Western Governers University, the best online instution I've every came across.</p>
